# Slides
* How it was generated
* Live Slides are generated using the provided makefile.
  * Somehow, my macbook didn't work and did not generate good slides.
  * I used a 11th gen Razer Blade (Basically, a windows computer) to generate the slides using the same makefile.
* PDF
  * This is done by opening up a live slides in browser (in my case, safari) and replace the end of the URL with `?print-pdf`.
  * The webpage will then change and show all the pages.
  * Use the print dialogue in the web browser to print the slides as a pdf.
